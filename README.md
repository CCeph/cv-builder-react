# CV Builder with React
My first project in react: a CV builder web application. The aim is to create a web application that allows the user to fill some input fields to customize a CV template.

## Intended Features:
The template updates live on user input.
A download button to download the template as a PDF.
(Optional) Mobile support.

## Available Features:
N/A

## To-do List:

1. Get a general idea of how to code downloading the CV as a PDF.
2. Create the base layout.
    -Create SidePanel and ResumeDisplay empty components
    -Create the rough layout for both and position them on the page
    -Pass both components props of state variables
    -Pass SidePanel the event handlers to update the state variables
    -Keep filling out the details.
3. Ensure CV updates live on user input.
4. Add a download button to download as PDF.
